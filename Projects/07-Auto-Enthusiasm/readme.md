### UPDATING/UNMOUNTING LIFECYCLE METHODS

componentWillUnmount
A componentâ€™s unmounting period occurs when the component is removed from the DOM. This could happen if the DOM is rerendered without the component, or if the user navigates to a different website or closes their web browser.

- componentWillUnmount is the only unmounting lifecycle method!
