## LESSON PropTypes

Learn to use propTypes to validate props and provide documentation.

Exercises

1. propTypes

2. Apply PropTypes

Give the BestSeller component class a propTypes property. For now, set propTypes equal to an empty object literal.

3. Add Properties to PropTypes

The name of each property in propTypes should be the name of an expected prop. In our case, MessageDisplayer expects a prop named message, so our propertyâ€™s name is message.

The value of each property in propTypes should fit this pattern:

```javascript
React.PropTypes.expected-data-type-goes-here
```
